    <h3>Place Of Birth</h3>

    <p>I was born and raised in a little cosmopolitan city by the <mark style="background-color: pink;">Atlantic Ocean</mark>, called Warri City. To find out more, please feel click on the following link: <a href="www.google.co.uk"><strong>Google</strong></a>. The need to live near water, would follow me throughtout my life.</p>

    <h3>Education</h3>

    <p>I was homeschooled until the age of 6, when I first went to primary school. <del>I found school very easy.</del> I found school exciting!!! I was so eager to learn, and with such amazing grades, I didn't need any sort of motivation, as I have always been self-motivated. I skipped my final year at primary school, and went straight on to secondary school. High school, despite the challenges of learning subjects like geography and chemistry, I still found the experience enjoyable. I made some life-long friends and created lots of precious memories. It wasn't until I went to university to study my 1st degree in Pure Mathematics, did I finally <i>stumble</i> upon my first real challenge - <b>Abstract Maths!</b> Despite my little obstacle, I graduated top of my class, with a <mark style="background-color: aqua;">BSc (Hons) in Mathematics, and further went on to study my <em>Master's (MSc) in Internet Computing.</em></mark></p>

    <h3 id="travels">Travels</h3>

    <p>I have been extremely priviledged to have travelled as much as I have. I feel blessed to have been to five out of the seven continents in the world! As my husband would rightfully say: <blockquote><b><q>travelling broadens the mind.</q></b></blockquote>For my travels, I would simply let my <a href="gallery.html">photos</a> speak for themselves. Please check out <a href="gallery.html">my gallery</a> </p>
    
    
    <p>I have <i>discovered</i> a whole lot about myself during our travels. My resilience, grit, ability to adapt, make new friends, adjust to harsh weather conditions - are all <b>rooted</b> <sub>below</sub> from my life lived in various countries.</p>

    <h3 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h3>

    <p>I love being by the seaside or lake - anywhere I can have a swim or go kayaking or simply build sandcastles. I even love the sounds of seagulls, as they remind me of the sea <sup>my happy place</sup>. My favourite thing to do, is swimming. <small>My other hobbies include</small> playing tennis, painting, going for walks in the trails, photography, singing, and of course, watching <b><i>Netflix</i></b>.</p>

    <h4>In a Nutshell</h4>   
    <p>I am an introverted extrovert, who enjoys the company of others but more importantly, enjoys my time with nature. I appreciate the beauty in nature, which is why I paint when inspired. My photography is also centred around capturing the beauty in nature. I am also a very logical person, with an analytical mind, so I enjoy enjoy solving scientific problems. I think my physics teacher was right. He believed that my being a southpaw, has its advantages, because my brain is able to be both very analytical and equally creative. He wasn't wrong.</p>
